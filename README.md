# Next.js CNR Starter

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) starter.

It features

-   Typescript
-   Tailwind
-   Meta tags in the `_document` file.
-   Password protection for development branches. Add PASSWORD_PROTECT to your environment variables. 
-   Other defaults:
    -   A robots.txt file
    -   A thin scrollbar
    -   A `components` folder
    -   A 404 page.

These are features I find myself using on every Next project. They might change significantly in future versions.

## Getting Started

Run the following command to create a new project with this Starter:

```bash
yarn create next-app my-app -e https://github.com/ideopunk/next-cnr-template
# or
npx create-next-app my-app -e https://github.com/ideopunk/next-cnr-template
```

Once the project and dependencies are finished installing, you can navigate to that directory and start up the development server with:

```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
````

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see your new project!
